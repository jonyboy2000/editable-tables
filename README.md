# excel-ui-for-web-tables-
Execl-like UI for Table-based Web Documents

To some extent this project is a training one. Its aim is to simulate some of most popular MS Excel UI hot keys in table-based web documents which are used in accounting, science, etc. 

To be exact, these javascript functions allow the user:
 - Turn on the edit mode in a table cell by Double Click;
 - Move to the next or previous cell by "Tab" or "Shift-Tab" with preserving the editing mode in the active cell; 
 - Stop editing by "Esc", "Enter" or a mouse click. 
 
These functions are designed as independent event handlers, so you can easy add them to other packages which enhance table fuctionality such as DTable and many others.
